# Stock Market Analysis

VBA script analyzing the stock market from 2014 to 2016 in three parts. 

### Part 1 (Easy):

* Create a script that will loop through each year of stock data and grab the total amount of volume each stock had over the year.
* Display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

### Part 2 (Moderate):

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.

  * Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.
  * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed
  * The total Volume of the stock
  * Ticker symbol

* Add conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

### Part 3 (Hard):

* Your solution will include everything from the moderate challenge.
* Your solution will also be able to locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
* Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.
